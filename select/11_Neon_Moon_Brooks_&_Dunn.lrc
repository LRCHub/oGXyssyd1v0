[00:02.21] When the sun goes down
[00:11.06] On my side of town
[00:13.18] That lonesome feelin'
[00:16.27] Comes to my door
[00:17.10] The whole world turns blue
[00:30.10] 
[00:25.27] There's a rundown bar
[00:30.06] Cross the railroad tracks
[00:32.19] I've got a table for two
[00:34.45] Way in the back
[00:36.73] Where I sit alone
[00:39.42] And think of losing you
[00:50.92] 
[00:43.48] I spend most every night
[00:48.48] Beneath the light
[00:50.35] Of a neon moon
[00:57.35] 
[00:53.97] Now If you lose your one and only
[00:59.35] There's always room here for the lonely
[01:04.15] To watch your broken dreams
[01:07.50] Dance in and out of the beams
[01:09.86] Of a neon moon
[01:16.86] 
[01:12.72] I think of two young lovers
[01:16.68] Running wild and free
[01:18.74] I close my eyes
[01:21.08] And sometimes see
[01:23.52] You in the shadows
[01:27.14] Of this smoke-filled room
[01:39.64] 
[01:30.93] No telling how many tears
[01:35.22] I've sat here and cried
[01:37.56] Or how many lies
[01:40.36] That I've lied
[01:42.45] Telling my poor heart
[01:44.81] He'll come back someday
[01:50.17] Ooh, but I'll be alright
[01:53.83] As long as there's light
[01:57.30] From a neon moon
[02:05.30] 
[02:00.33] Ooh, if you lose your one and only
[02:04.92] There's always room here for the lonely
[02:09.78] So watch your broken dreams
[02:13.29] Dance in and out of the beams
[02:15.10] Of a neon moon
[02:22.10] 
[02:18.42] The jukebox plays on
[02:42.02] Drink by drink
[02:43.22] And the words of every sad song
[02:46.40] Seem to say what I think
[02:47.99] And this hurt inside of me
[02:50.86] Ain't never gonna end
[03:01.36] 
[02:55.07] Ooh, but I'll be alright
[02:59.45] As long as there's light
[03:02.12] From a neon moon
[03:10.12] 
[03:05.28] Ooh, if you lose your one and only
[03:10.61] There's always room here for the lonely
[03:15.22] To watch your broken dreams
[03:18.44] Dance in and out of the beams
[03:20.74] Of a neon moon
[03:27.74] 
[03:23.21] To watch your broken dreams
[03:27.85] Dance in and out of the beams
[03:29.98] Of a neon moon
[03:36.98] 
[03:32.23] Ooh, watch your broken dreams
[03:37.37] Dance in and out of the beams
[03:39.46] Of a neon moon
