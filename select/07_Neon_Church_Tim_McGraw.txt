I need Jesus or I need whiskey
Whatever works best to get me
Through
Gettin' over you

A little Friday night hallelujah
A congregation of backsliders
Just like me
Yeah, what I need

Is a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church

Baptize me in that barroom smoke
Bartender, preach to me 'til my heart ain't broke
No more
Ain't that what this place is for?
Now I tried bended knee, hands-up prayin'
But damn did that hurt don't just keep hangin'
Around
What I need right now

Is a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church

Liquor sippin' down that unholy water
Save that hurt-like-hell for tomorrow
I'll stay here all night

In a neon church
With the party crowd
Where the good times roll
And the music's loud
Instead of home starin' holes in the ceiling
I got a feeling

I need a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'
I got a feelin'
I need a neon church
