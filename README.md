NEON LIGHTS
WOKE UP IN HELL FOR A DAY
YOUR BODY'S ON FIRE
MY SOUL IS IN FLAMES
DOWNTOWN MY CITY IS GRAY
BUT I GOT THE SHINE IT'S IN MY DNA
SING IT NA NA NA
BLINDED BY THE
NANANA
I'M BLINDED BY THE
NEON LIGHTS
SHINING BRIGHT ON THE INNOCENT
SHIBUYA NIGHTS
BURNING BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN
NEON LIGHTS
WHAT A TIME TO BE LIVING IN
SHIBUYA NIGHTS
LIVE FOREVER TILL THE MORNING COMES
GETTING IT ALL FOR FREE
LIVING A STRUING-OUT DREAM
LIVING A FANTASY
NEON LIGHTS
SHINING BRIGHT ON THE INNOCENT
EVERY ONE OF THEM
NEON LIGHTS
WAKE UP GO MISBEHAVE
GET THE FUCK OFF THE COUCH
TURN THE STREETS TO A RAVE
BLACK OUT DRINK TILL WE FADE
MAKE YOUR DADDY ASHAMED
FROM TOKYO TO L.A.
SING IT NA NA NA
BLINDED BY THE
NANANA
SHIBUYA
NEON LIGHTS
SHINING BRIGHT ON THE INNOCENT
SHIBUYA NIGHTS
BURNING BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN
NEON LIGHTS
WHAT A TIME TO BE LIVING IN
SHIBUYA NIGHTS
LIVE FOREVER TILL THE MORNING COMES
GETTING IT ALL FOR FREE
LIVING A STRUNG-OUT DREAM
LIVING A FANTASY
NEON LIGHTS
SHINING BRIGHT ON THE INNOCENT
EVERY ONE OF THEM
NEON
NEON LIGHTS
SHINING BRIGHT ON THE INNOCENT
SHIBUYA NIGHTS
BURNING BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN
NEON LIGHTS
WHAT A TIME TO BE LIVING IN
SHIBUYA NIGHTS
LIVE FOREVER TILL THE MORNING COMES
GETTING IT ALL FOR FREE
LIVING A STRUNG-OUT DREAM
LIVING A FANTASY
NEON LIGHTS
SHINING BRIGHT ON THE INNOCENT
EVERY ONE OF THEM
NEON LIGHTS
